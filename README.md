# üì• ChicKernel permalinks
### [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/chickendrop89/device_xiaomi_unified-kernel/releases/latest) | [**SourceForge mirror**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chickernel-xiaomi-tapas-kernel) | [**XDA Forums thread**](https://xdaforums.com/t/kernel-chickernel-a-kernel-optimized-for-smoothness-and-low-memory.4678538) 

# üìù Note:
This kernel is tuned for these SDM685 (`sm6225-AD`) devices:
- Xiaomi Redmi Note _12_ 4G (`topaz` / `tapas`)
- Xiaomi Redmi Note _13_ 4G (`sapphire` / `sapphiren`)

# üèóÔ∏è Notes (for developers):
### **Cloning this source:**
1. *This repo has kernelSU as a git submodule*. This means it has to be cloned with `--recurse-submodules`
2. Since this is default branch, use the `-b` switch to clone a different one (eg. `android13-5.15-lts`)
3. You can use the `--depth=1` argument to make a lighter shallow clone (not recommended)

### **This kernel is built with these configurations:**
- `build.config.gki.aarch64.chickernel`
- `build.config.gki.aarch64.chickernel.ksu`
- `build.config.gki.aarch64.chickernel.ksu.susfs` **(SuSFS branch)**

This kernel is built with a newer toolchain as defined in `build.config.constants`
- Ensure you have the correct prebuilt downloaded from [this site](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/+/refs/heads/main)

### **Upstreaming kernelSU:**
- Change directory to your source directory and run:
```shell
git submodule update --init --remote
```

### **Upstreaming SuSFS:**
- Upstreaming SuSFS implementation in kernel is kinda tricky, because it involves applying patches, and re-doing everything
- [Clone the `gki-android13-5.15` branch into your working directory outside the kernel](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu/-/tree/gki-android13-5.15), 
and after you do the 1st step mentioned below, do everything as according the guide in it's [README](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu/-/blob/gki-android13-5.15/README.md)

I do it someway like this:
1. First, [i revert previous implementation commit](https://github.com/chickendrop89/device_xiaomi_unified-kernel/commit/07f7d604fb4695e0735f0ab3e88e6ed57a90adf3)
2. I merge the directories from `kernel_patches/` to my tree
3. I apply the patch: `git apply *.patch --whitespace=fix`
4. I commit, and push to origin
